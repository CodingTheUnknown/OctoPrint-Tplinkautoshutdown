# OctoPrint-Tplinkautoshutdown

This plugin is designed to help you integrate your IoT TP-Link Kasa wireless plug into OctoPrint. The basis of the plug-in is to enable you to automatically switch-off your 3D printer
once a print has successfully completed.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/jamesmccannon02/OctoPrint-Tplinkautoshutdown/archive/master.zip

Installation can be achieved through two options. The first and simplest option is to use the plugin manager within OctoPrint and search for TpLinkHandler. Then upon installation all you need to do is re-start you device and the plugin will be installed and ready for use.

#### Connection to a device
To connect your Kasa device, you will need to click the settings icon within the navigation bar and then down the right-hand side of your screen (under ‘plugins’) you can select the ‘TpLinkHandler’. Then type the IP address of your smart-plug and click save. Now you are ready.

## compatibility
Although, this plugin may work with a number of other Kasa devices, this plugin has been designed to definitively work with the following devices.

#### Smart Plugs:
* HS100
* HS103
* HS105
* HS107
* HS110
